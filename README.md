I have developed a brochure website for Manav Steel using React.js.
The website serves as an online presence for the company, 
showcasing its products, services, and contact details.
It includes a "Send Quotation" feature, allowing customers to
inquire about products by submitting their details through a form.
The admin can view these quotations through a dedicated section in
the admin panel. The site is designed to be visually appealing, informative,
and easy to navigate, effectively representing the company's brand and offerings.
